# Data

All raw data files are gitignored. To reproduce the analysis, obtain the
following data and place them in the specified directories.

## Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX)

- **Source**: [BLS CEX Public Use Microdata](https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd_data.htm)
- **Files needed**: Interview survey zip archives (`intrvw13.zip` through
  `intrvw23.zip`) and the hierarchy groupings stubs archive (`stubs.zip`).
- **Location**: Place zip archives in `data/raw/cex/zipdata/` and the stubs
  archive as `data/raw/cex/stubs.zip`.

## Consumer Price Index (CPI)

- **Aggregate CPI**: Download the CPIAUCSL series from
  [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CPIAUCSL) and save as
  `data/raw/cpi/CPI.csv`. The file should have columns `DATE` and
  `CPIAUCSL`.
- **Sectoral CPI**: 23 sectoral price series from FRED, saved as individual
  CSV files in `data/raw/cpi/sectoral/`. Each file is named after its sector
  code (e.g., `FOODHOME.csv`, `SHELTER.csv`) and has columns `DATE` and the
  FRED series value.

and will be regenerated by running `main.R`.
